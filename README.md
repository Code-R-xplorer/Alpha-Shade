## About the game
In Alpha Shade, step into the shoes of a skilled agent in my 3D first-person stealth game. Inspired by popular titles like Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell and the Hitman series, your mission is to infiltrate a high-security weapons company and steal the plans for their latest battle droids. With an arsenal of gadgets and weapons at your disposal, outsmart and outmanoeuvre guards as you navigate through a complex and immersive world. Can you complete your mission undetected and escape with valuable intel?

Alpha Shade is a 3D first-person stealth game, developed in Unity as part of my Final Project for my BSc Games Programming degree.
